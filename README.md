This project was built for the 2021 Retro Gaming Hackathon of Code Institute.
The purpose of the project was to build a retro-styled game based on the earliest developed computer games, as well as growing as (aspiring) developers by working together as a team and managing version control of the to-be developed product.

#### Typography

For this project we used the "Press Start 2P" (designed by CodeMan38) as a font.
This is a pixellated font and it brings out the retro feel of the early era of gaming.

## Team

### - [Andrew Dempsey](https://github.com/andrewdempsey2018)
  - I have been a passionate gamer ever since my father bought me a Sega Megadrive. This project was extremely challenging but immensely rewarding. It has introduced me to new technologies and it has highlighted areas that I need to improve. Best of all, it has introduced me to new friends in the coding world! Game on!!

### - [Helena Johansson](https://github.com/Odden69)
  - I am probably the person in this team with the least gaming experience. But I am the oldest, hence the most retro. Joining this hackathon has been so rewarding. I have learned so much from my fabulous fellow team mates.

### - [John Doyle](https://github.com/Aramantos)
  - Gaming has always been a passion of mine so this hackathon was a must. A retro game will make a proud addition to the portfolio and it was a great experience shaping it with the team. Hope you all enjoy it.

### - [Katherine Biggs](https://github.com/Kat632)
  - I've been gaming since I was about 8. I had an Acorn Electron. These days I'm a Simmer. The fastest thing I can type is "testingcheatsenabled true". This is a Sims joke that probably no one will understand.  When I started this Hackathon, I had no idea that I would be doing the final commit - I didn't even know how to use git!

### - [Patrik Österljung](https://github.com/oljung)
  - Ever since I played the NES at my uncles when I was five, gaming has been a huge part of my life. When I saw this Hackathon, I had to join even though I knew nothing about what it mean. Now that I know, that it means working with a team to make a project take form, I can safely say this will not be my last. This has been awesome! Thank you guys and please enjoy the game!

### - [Yorick van den Hurk](https://github.com/nowane)
  - I've always had a lot of fun gaming when I was a kid. Seeing this theme for a hackathon come by was the last push I needed to engage more in the Code Institute community. Luckily I landed in an awesome team of truely awesome characters, with who I've been glad to had the pleasure working with.

### - Special thanks go out to our facilitator Mairéad Hannon
- Mairead from Code Institute was extremely generous with her time. She was there for us to make sure we stayed focused on our tasks. She was happy to give us direction and discuss ideas. She was there for us when we had issues & checked in with us for progress updates. Without her, we couldn't have done it, thank you!!
